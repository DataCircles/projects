# Analysis of Traffic Collision Data

These materials relate to the workshops for analyzing Seattle area traffic collision data.

The Projects Circle Team is excited to launch a data science project analyzing Seattle traffic collision data to help prioritize road improvements and prevent future collisions. This is an opportunity to work through a project with real world data from beginning to end in a small team with experienced data scientists.

To prepare for this project we are hosting two virtual workshops:  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) at 6 p.m. on June 24th  
- Time Series Analysis at 6 p.m. on July 1st.  

Data science knowledge is not required, but prior experience with Jupyter notebooks and Python is important.

#### Sponsor

This project and workshop are sponsored by the [Data Circles](datacircles.org) organization.  

Data Circles (formerly SeaWiDS) exists to provide a place for women in data science to connect, build community, support each other and grow. In less than two years Data Circles, has grown into a community with more than 1,800 members.  

Teams of volunteers organize monthly events in the Greater Seattle area, including: technical talks, informational panels, career development workshops, hackathons, conferences, networking events, book clubs, mentoring, study sessions, and interview prep.

The Projects Circle Team is an initiative from the Data Circles organization that provides participants with real-world experience developing a data science project from conceptualization to execution.
