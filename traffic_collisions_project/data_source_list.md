[csv link](https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8c267378731b49a1923233282f81a3c2_0.csv)  
[shapefile link](https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8c267378731b49a1923233282f81a3c2_0.zip)

#### [Street Network Database (SND)](http://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/street-network-database-snd?showData=true)  
[CSV file](https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8c267378731b49a1923233282f81a3c2_0.csv)  
[shapefile link](https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0dd0ad79dc3845f3a296215d7c448a0d_2.zip)  

About 34,179 records decribing the physical, land based, improved, travel pathway infrastructure and associated theoretical address ranges. The pathway representation consists of Segments and Intersection elements. A Segment is a linear graphic element that represents a continuous physical travel path terminated by path end (dead end) or physical intersection with other travel paths. Segments have one street name, one address range and one set of segment characteristics. A Segment may have none or multiple alias street names.  
Segment types included are Freeways, Highways, Streets, Alleys (named only), Railroads, Walkways, and Bike lanes. SNDSEG is a linear feature class representing the SND Segment Feature, with attributes for Street name, Address Range, Alias Street name and segment Characteristics objects. Part of the Address Range and all of Street name objects are logically shared with the Discrete Address Point-Master Address File layer.

## Related Data

This section includes weather, location and demographic information, or anything else potentially useful for machine learning or data visualization.  

#### [Road Weather Information Stations](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Road-Weather-Information-Stations/egc4-d24i) 
About 869,000 records from sensor stations placed on bridges and surface streets within city limits. Each station has a temperature sensor that measures the temperature of the street surface and a sensor that measures the ambient air temperature at the station each second. Those values are averaged into temperature readings that are recorded by the station every minute. The dataset is updated every hour with new data.  
__Note__: the description states that "Only 2 days of data is stored in the dataset," but there are some records from 2019... 
```
Column Name	- Description	
StationName	- Name of the station including location description.
StationLocation	- Latitude and longitude of the station.
DateTime	- Date and time of the temperature readings.

#### [Seattle CRA Neighborhoods](http://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/fbf6ca85b6b0408da346c8896b6f8aef_0)

CSV file has 11 Columns: OBJECTID; Community Reporting Area Number; Community Reporting Area Group; Alias; DETL_NAMES; 	 Neighborhood District;	AREA_ACRES; AREA_SQMI; Shape; SHAPE_Length; SHAPE_Area  
 
Community reporting areas (CRAs) are designed to address a gap that existed in city geography. The task of reporting citywide information at a "community-like level" across all departments was either not undertaken or it was handled in inconsistent ways across departments. The CRA geography provides a "common language" for geographic description of the city for reporting purposes. Therefore, this geography may be used by departments for geographic reporting and tracking purposes.  

The following criteria for a CRA geography were defined for this effort:  
- no overlapping areas;  
- complete coverage of the city; 
- suitable scale to represent neighborhood areas/conditions; 
- reasonably stable over time;  
- consistent with census geography; 
- relatively easy to use in a data context; 
- familiar system of common place names;  
- and respects neighborhood district geography.  

The following existing geographies were reviewed during this effort:  
- neighborhood planning areas (DON);  
- neighborhood districts (DON/CNC/Neighborhood District Councils);  
- city sectors/neighborhood plan implementation areas (DON);  
- urban centers/urban villages (DPD);  
- population sub-areas (DPD);  
- Neighborhood Map Atlas (City Clerk);  
- Census 2000 geography;  
- topography;  
- and various other geographic information sources related to neighborhood areas and common place names.  
This is not an attempt to identify neighborhood boundaries as defined by neighborhoods themselves.
