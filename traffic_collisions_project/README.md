# Traffic Collisions Project

This six week project analyzes the Seattle area traffic collision data collected by the Seattle Dept. of Transportation (SDOT) over the period, 2004 - 2020.  

This repository contains general project documentation, [workshop materials](https://github.com/DataCircles/projects_circle/tree/master/traffic_collisions_project/workshop_materials), and other resources for the teams working on the Traffic Collisions Project. The teams focus on different business questions and will deliver different data science products. Each team falls under one of two tracks:  

__1. Data Visualization Emphasis Track__  
Input: geolocation data on collisions, road conditions, weather conditions  
Output 1: Generate maps with geopandas, folium, pandas  
Output 2: Generate dashboard with Tableau, Google data studio  

__2. Machine Learning Emphasis Track__  
Input: geolocation data on collisions, road conditions, weather conditions  
Output 1. Classify and label collisions based on degree of danger, decide how to classify what constitutes a dangerous or not dangerous intersection  
Output 2. Predict the danger level of each intersection  
Output 3. Recommend changes to improve dangerous intersections based on similarity metrics  

Each team will have their own GitHub repository within the projects_circle repository:

__Machine Learning Team 1 Repository - TBD__  

__Machine Learning Team 2 Repository - TBD__  

## Project Tasks and Milestones

### Week 0 (aka week of Project Kickoff)  
#### Tasks
1. Introduce yourselves to your teammates  
2. Document the business problem(s) and scope of the project

a. how to communicate, e.g. email, Slack  
b. how to track team progress, e.g. Trello, GitHub Project Board, Google Doc  
c. how to work collaboratively, e.g. GitHub repository, Google Drive  
d. how to divide up the work, e.g. assign team roles, work independently then compare  
#### Milestone(s)

2. Select a team representative to deliver a team progress report at standup meeting  

### Week 1 
#### Tasks
1. Produce a Jupyter notebook with a data report to document:  
a. the structure and statistics of the raw data  
b. how the data can help answer the business problem(s)  
c. what additional data is needed to answer the business problem(s)  
2. Locate the additional data
#### Milestone(s)
1. Deliver the data report. Report should be in each team's repository by 6 p.m. on Wednesday, July 22nd.
