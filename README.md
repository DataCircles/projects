# Projects Circle

This is the public repository containing materials for workshops and projects sponsored by the Projects Circle. The Projects Circle organizes real-world data science projects for members of the [Data Circles](https://datacircles.org) organization.  

## Mission

One of the difficulties for newcomers to the field is getting experience with creating end to end projects in a collaborative environment. The goal of this circle is to provide participants with “real world” experience developing a data science project from conceptualization to execution. We will have mentors and partners to guide assistants through the whole process and ensure that they get the necessary tools to develop data science projects independently.

## Recent Work

### WiDS Datathon 2021
This year's datathon is again analyzing data from MIT’s [GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score)](https://gossis.mit.edu/) initiative.  
Checkout the [wids_datathon_2021](https://github.com/DataCircles/projects_circle/tree/master/wids_datathon_2021) directory for more details. 
Additional information about the national datathon is available on the [WiDS site](https://www.widsconference.org/datathon.html) and the [Kaggle competition site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021/overview).  

## Prior Work

### Traffic Collision Data Project (7/8/20 - 8/26/20)
The Projects Circle is currently supporting three data science teams while they analyze Seattle area traffic collision data.  
Additional information can be found in the [traffic_collisions_project](https://github.com/DataCircles/projects_circle/tree/master/traffic_collisions_project) directory  

### WiDS Datathon 2020
The Women in Data Science (WiDS) initiative aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and to support women in the field. The WiDS Datathon was a collaboration led by the Global WiDS team at Stanford, the West Big Data Innovation Hub, and the WiDS Datathon committee. The WiDS Datathon 2020 focused on patient health, analyzing data from MIT’s [GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score)](https://gossis.mit.edu/) initiative.  
The Projects Circle supported the datathon teams from the Seattle region by organizing teams, providing mentors and presenting workshops.  
Additional information about the national datathon is available on the [WiDS site](https://www.widsconference.org/datathon.html) and the [Kaggle competition site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2020/leaderboard#score).
