# Projects Circle

This is the public repository containing materials for workshops and projects sponsored by the Projects Circle. The Projects Circle organizes real-world data science projects for members of the [Data Circles](https://datacircles.org) organization.  

## Mission

One of the difficulties for newcomers to the field is getting experience with creating end to end projects in a collaborative environment. The goal of this circle is to provide participants with “real world” experience developing a data science project from conceptualization to execution. We will have mentors and partners to guide assistants through the whole process and ensure that they get the necessary tools to develop data science projects independently.
