# WiDS Datathon 2021

Many members of Data Circles community are competing in the Datathon, so the Projects Circle is providing weekly "mentor office hours" to help. We are still recruiting data scientists to help answer questions and provide limited mentoring to teams.  

The [kickoff event](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-WiDS-Meetup/events/275618975/) was on Wednesday, January 20th at 6 PM and here are the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EKr0vs41YYmZuSxoP8xcf44wVMMM3FdE/view).  

We'll meet every Wednesday evening to answer questions and check in with the teams, link to [Meetup week 1](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-WiDS-Meetup/events/knzmdsycccbkc/).  

#### Next benchmarks
For Wednesday, February 3rd -- have a notebook with your initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preliminary training and testing data sets. Be prepared to describe an initial insight you discovered during your EDA.
