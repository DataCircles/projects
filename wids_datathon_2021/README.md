# WiDS Datathon 2021

Many members of Data Circles are competing, so the Projects Circle is providing weekly "office hours" to help.  

We are still recruiting data scientists to help answer questions and provide limited mentoring to teams.  

The [kickoff event](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-WiDS-Meetup/events/275618975/) is on Wednesday, January 20th at 6 PM.
